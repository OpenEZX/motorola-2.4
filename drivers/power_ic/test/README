Power IC test code
------------------

The code in this directory is used to test the power IC driver. This software
is not included in any kernel build. Also, since some of thest test apps provide
generic access to all power IC registers, the apps are not released in any
filesystem image - they have to be imported manually.

Makefile    - makes the various test tools to be run on a phone.
test_pcap.c - pcap-specific application to test power IC driver.


How to build
------------

To build, cd to this test directory and run 'make <target>'. The Makefile 
knows about the following targets:

   test_pcap: builds test_pcap.c for the PCAP-specific test app.
