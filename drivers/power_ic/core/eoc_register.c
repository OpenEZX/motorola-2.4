 * @brief Low-level interface to EMU One Chip registers
 *
 * The communication to the EMU One Chip is done through the I2C bus connected
 * to the processor.  To use the I2C bus, the following needs to happen:
 *
 *    - Register the I2C driver for the EMU One Chip
 *    - Wait for an I2C adapter to be registered
 *    - Register the I2C client for the EMU One Chip.  The client is considered
 *      a combination of a driver and adapter.
 *
 * Once those things are finished, the driver can use the standard I2C functions
 * to send and receive data from the EMU One Chip.
