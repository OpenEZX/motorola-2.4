 *
 * @brief Low-level interface to the Funlight registers
 *
 * Using the connection of the I2C bus to the processor, the Funlight Chip, LP3944 can be accessed.  
 * In order for this to occur, a couple things must first happen. 
 * 
 *    - The I2C driver must be registered for the Funlight Chip to use.  
 *    - We must then wait for the I2C adaptor to be registered. 
 *    - An I2C client has to be registered, which will contain the driver and the adapter.
 *
 * Once all of this is complete, the I2C functions can be used to read, write and transfer data from
 * the Funlight Chip.
 *
 * The Funlight Chip has 10 registers, three of which will never be used.  Register 1, 8, and 9 are
 * empty and non-functional registers.  Register 1 is read-only and has all the bits hard-wired to 
 * zero.  Registers 8 and 9 can be written and read, but the contents does not have any effect on the
 * operation of the Funlight Chip.
 * 
 * The registers that are used on the Funlight Chip are as follows, along with the LED controls:
 *
 * REGISTERS
 *    - Input 1 (Read Only) - LED0-7 input register
 *    - PSC0    (R/W)       - Frequency Prescaler 0...used to program the period of DIM0
 *    - PWM0    (R/W)       - PWM Register 0...determines the duty cycle of DIM0 
 *    - PSC1    (R/W)       - Frequency Prescaler 1...used to program the period of DIM1
 *    - PWM1    (R/W)       - PWM Register 1...determines the duty cycle of DIM1
 *    - LS0     (R/W)       - LED0-3 Selector
 *    - LS1     (R/W)       - LED4-7 Selector
 *
 * LED Control
 *    - LED0 (bits 0 and 1) controls the Red LED
 *    - LED1 (bits 2 and 3) controls the Green LED
 *    - LED2 (bits 4 and 5) controls the Blue LED
 *    - LED3 (bits 6 and 7) controls the CLI backlight
 *    - LED4 (bits 0 and 1) controls the Main Display backlight
 *
