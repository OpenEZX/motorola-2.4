 * @brief Power IC charging control interface.
 *
 * This module implements the interface for controlling the charging hardware.
 * This provides basic control over charging voltage and current and the 
 * configuration of the power path. This module does not include any charging
 * algorithm.
 * 
 * @todo Need to figure out how to use overvoltage hardware for EMU one-chip. 
 * power_ic_charger_get_overvoltage() and power_ic_charger_reset_overvoltage()
 * are provided as an equivalent for these controls in AUL, but they don't seem
 * to do anything - sense bit doesn't go high when charger overvoltage occurs
 * (though EMU does shut off the charger) and charging resumes autonomously
 * without resetting the hardware.

 * @brief initialises the charger hardware.

 * This function is used to set the initial power path. if the battery voltage 
 * is too low to support the phone, the path is set to dual-path to allow the 
 * charger to supply the phone while slowly charging up the battery. Otherwise,
 * current-sharing is selected as the battery can make up any shortfall.
 *
 * @bug Ideally, this function should be passed the power-up reason so that 
 * the path is also set according to whether a charger is present or not. 
 * However, a lot of powerups are currently detected as power cuts, which 
 * have a higher priority than the charger, so this cannot be added yet.
 *
 * @todo Requirements issue: does driver need to set power path based on charger
 * and battery voltage at powerup, or can it wait until SBCM starts a few seconds later?
 * Init code commented out for now.
