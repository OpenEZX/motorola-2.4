			commands are handled using the PrepareAndSendCommand
			function for sending of the above commands.
		4. In wlan_stdcmd_ioctl(), the command in queued and the
			main thread is wokenup instead of calling the
			DownloadCommandToStation(), for handling STDCMD.

			in wlan_wext.c. These functions are used to send the
			AD_HOC_STOP and DEAUTHENTICATE commands respectively.

			compiler flag ADHOCAES
		3. Removed setadhockey and getadhockey private commands
			(keep in wlanconfig only)

01/24/05:  version 25
		1. Added IBSS Privacy check for WEP/AES in ad-hoc start/join

01/21/05:  version 25
		1. In Makefile, Removed ACTIVE_SCAN, NO_CMD_RESP compile flags, 
			As they are not used at all. 
		2. In Makefile, INTR_SLEEP is Added to CFLAGS only when 
			PER_CMD_WAIT_Q is disabled.
		3. Removed Roaming related code.
		4. Fixed issue of kernel crash with authalgs private command.
		5. Moved thread handler funtions to wlan_main.c and re-named

			to Adapter
		9. Added NetworkEAP AuthType = 0x80
		10. Added sub-command "encryptionmode" for supplicant & iwpriv
		11. Rewrote IsNetworkCompatible() in wlan_fw.h

01/20/05:  version 25
		1. Removed the array CmdRespRetCode[MRVDRV_NUM_OF_CMD_BUFFER]
			from the adapter structure. We now have one variable 
			'retcode'' in the CmdCtrlNode structure to handle this.
			In new implementation, prepare and send command returns
			the status 'ret', if (ret ==  0) indicates that the 
			command is  successful, if (ret < 0) indicates that the 
			command preparation failed, Note: 'ret' will be greater
			than zero only if the PER_CMD_WAIT_Q is enabled and it 
			is used to send the command. So, if (ret > 0) indicates
			that the command response returned error.		
			Thus 'retcode' variable holds the command response 
			return code only if the PER_CMD_WAIT_Q macro is enabled
			and it is used to send the command.
		2. Used memcpy to copy the structure contents, instead of 
			copying indivisual structure variables one by one.
		3. Removed Wlan802_11AuthModeWPA* from enum
			_WLAN_802_11_AUTHENTICATION_MODE in wlan_defs.h
			Added ModeNetworkEAP

		5. Added *_MCAST_CIPHER definitions/data structire/functions
		6. Added WPA2_IE 
		7. Added wlan_associate() and moved PrepareAndSendCommand calls
			for _ASSOCIATE to this function in wlan_wext.c
		8. Removed IsWPAEnabled in wlan_fw.h

01/19/05:  version 25
		1. Fixed the problem of CmdNode free issue.
			Changes are made in wlan_cmd.c, wlan_cmdresp.c
			and wlan_fw.c files.
		2. Partially implemented the command response error handling.
			Currently the error handling is done in the 
			wlan_set_rate().
			For the above implementation added the variable,
			'int CmdRespRetCode[MRVDRV_NUM_OF_CMD_BUFFER]' in the 
			adapter structure and 'int id' in the CmdCtrlNode 
			structure.
			They are initialized in AllocateCmdBuffer() 
			in wlan_cmd.c.

			In this implementation, prepare and send command returns
			a 'ret' value. if (ret < 0), indicates that the command 
			preparation has failed. if (ret >= 0), indicates that 
			the 'ret' contains command node id, which is used for 
			tracking the command response return code. That is 
			CmdRespRetCode[ret] gives the command response error 
			code of the command that is sent.
		
			Note:	CmdRespRetCode[ret] contain the valid response 
				error code only if we wait for the response 
				after sending the command. That is, it is valid 
				only if PER_CMD_WAIT_Q is defined and used for 
				sending the command or 
				'wlan_sched_timeout(delay)' or 
				interruptible_sleep_on()' are used after 
				sending the command.
		3. Added private ioctl regarding ATIM in ad-hoc power-save.
			
			usage:
			# iwpriv eth1 atim <value>
				`to set the ATIM period value, which has to be 
					upto 50`
		4. Merged GSPI_BUS_CONFIG command and handling
		5. Removed WPA_AES compiler flag
		6. Moved sending AUTHENTICATE command from wlan_set_essid() &
			wlan_set_wap() in wlan_wext.c to
			wlan_cmd_802_11_associate() in wlan_cmd.c
		7. Added WLANSET8021XAUTHALG for 802.1x authentication algs
			Usage: # iwpriv eth1 8021xauthalgs <value>

01/18/05:  version 25
		1. Modified wlan_config.c application file to support for 
			subcommand implementation in host driver.
		2. Modified WLANSETADHOCAES switch case to handle the wrq 
			structure passed from the user space.

		2. Added find_cfp_by_band_and_freq() function and fixed Linux null
			pointer issue in wlan_set_freq() when "iwconfig eth1 channel x"
			is invoked in ad-hoc mode before any AP scanning
		3. Fixed non-Progressive scan in wlan_cmd_802_11_scan():
			wrong channl numbers were filled in the scan list
			so not able to scan/associate to APs in channel 3,6,8,9,10 
		4. Modified *_DRIVER_RELEASE_VERSION per project in wlan_version.h
		5. Increased length of version string from 32 to 128 bytes in wlan_wext.c

01/12/05:  version 24
		1. Added "#if WIRELESS_EXT > 14" conditional compiling
			in wlan_wext.c for WE14/15/16 compatibilities.
		2. In wlan_scan_networks(): in the following cases,
			1) PROGRESSIVE_SCAN is used (no matter PER_CMD_WAIT_Q is defined
				or not);
			2) neither PROGRESSIVE_SCAN nor PER_CMD_WAIT_Q is defined;
			call interruptible_sleep_on_timeout(&scan_q) function to wait
			10 seconds for the scan response.
		3. Added KERNEL_WE for Wireless Ext 14/15/16 in Makefile
		4. Changed omap1510-linux kernel directory to "/usr/src/omap1510-linux-we15"

		2. Changed "#define __inline" to "#define _inline" 
			in wlan_defs.h to remove the compilation errors
			when the code was compiled with linux-2.4.28
		3. Changed data type of RFI variable "mode" from "u8" to "u16"
		4. Changed main_thread to sleep on waiting for command rsp of
			previous command even new command is pending

01/10/05:  version 24
		1. Merged the THREADX code.
		2. Added ioctl command WLANREGCFWR and definition in 
			wlan_wext.h and wlan_wext.c to support read
			and write of CF registers.
		3. Modified wlan_config.c
			Added function definitions process_read_cfreg() and
			process_write_cfreg() to support the above mentioned
			feature addition.

01/10/05:  version 23
		1. Commented the code, 
				ptr += sprintf(ptr, "*");
				break;
			in wlan_get_scan(), since the card was unable to
			associate to the WPA enabled AP.

			2) BAND_B matches B or G
			3) BAND_G matches G or B
		6. In SendActiveScan(), do active scan only if Scan is NOT in progress
			This is to fix the following issue:
			1) scan during reassociation
		7. In wlan_get_scan(), removed GET_RF_CHANNEL command and using Adapter->Channel
			to fix the following issue:
			1) scan after ad-hoc start/join
		8. In wlan_get_scan(), removed passing actual wpa_ie string to iwtools
			This to to save space for listing more APs in scan results
		9. Added CmdWaitQWoken to CmdCtrlNode structure
		10.In PrepareAndSendCommand(), wait_event_interruptible(cmdwait_q, CmdWaitQWoken);
			instead of interruptible_sleep_on(&cmdwait_q);

01/04/05:  version 23
		1. Implementing the region channel in the common module.
 		   ( Not yet completed ).
		2. Modified the data structure _HostCmd_DS_802_11_RF_TX_POWER

		5. Added wlan_sched_timeout(200) for AFC commands in 
			wlan_freq_ctrl() in wlan_wext.c

12/28/04:  version 23
		1. Changed status string to "setting to on/off" for
			Enter/Exit Deep Sleep private command: bug #2948,#2953
		2. Added setting MRVDRV_MAX_TX_POWER at device init time

		7. Commented out "SendActiveScan" and "FindSSIDInList" calls
			in wlan_set_wap()

12/23/04:  version 23
		1. In wlan_service_main_thread(), After the check
			if(Adapter->PSState == PS_STATE_SLEEP)
		   the Adapter variable 'IntCounter' is decremented.
		   (but not set to zero)

		   This is to make sure that, we don't schedule out
		   the main thread even after we got the awake event. 

		   That is, if the interrupt is generated for awake event 
		   just after the check, 
			if(Adapter->PSState == PS_STATE_SLEEP)
		   and before cli() is called, 'IntCounter' is incremented in 
		   the interrupt service routine.
		   So, in the main thread if we set the 'IntCounter' to zero 
		   after cli() and then continue() is called, the main thread 
		   will schedule out even though the driver got the awake event.

		   To avoid this happening, 'IntCounter' is decremented.
		2. Removed SPIN8385 flag
		3. Changed version buffer len from 64 to 128

12/22/04:  version 23
		1. In wlan_service_main_thread(), After the check
			if(Adapter->PSState == PS_STATE_SLEEP)
		   the Adapter variable 'IntCounter' is set to zero.

		   This is done to increase the CPU idle time from 30% to 95%
		   when the card is put to power save mode on BULVERDE.
		   (verified using the 'top' command).
		   
		   Observed that when the card is in PS_STATE_SLEEP, 
		   IntCounter is not zero, thus the thread is continiously 
		   running and consuming lot of CPU time. 
		2. Removed FW_DATA_RATE flag; added G_RATE flag for W8385
		3. Added G_AdhocRates[] in wlan_main.c
		4. Rewrote wlan_get_range() function for data rates: #2890
		5. Removed Adapter->adhoc_start_ch (AdhocChannel is used):

		2. MAX_CH_TIME_MULTI_BANDS changed to 10ms (was 100ms)
		3. Fixed #bug 1100,
			i.e, accepts invalid command '$iwpriv ethX deepsleep 3'.
			If the deepsleep command is issued with the options 
			other than '0', '1' & '2', the command is returned with 
			the appropriate error code. The fix is added in 
			do_ioctl(), in wlan_wext.c
		4. Modified the function get_common_rates(), to solve the
			problem when the rates are not in 'small to large' order
		5. SupportedRates_A updated

		4. Hardcoded AdhocRates for _ad_hoc_start() in wlan_cmd.c
		5. G-SuppordedRates array updated in wlan_main.c
		6. Added Commands_Allowed_In_PS and it's handling in wlan_cmd.c
		7. Added 802.11 RSSI command into Commands_Allowed_In_PS
			if MULTI_BANDS is enabled
		8. Removed unused code in wlan_wext.c
		
12/16/04:  version 22
		1. Added new private ioctl wlanidle.
			usage:
			$ iwpriv eth1 wlanidle-off
				--to get into idle state
			$ iwpriv eth1 wlanidle-on
				--to come out of idle state
		2. Before going to DeepSleep, netif_carrier_off is called
			and after exiting from DeepSleep, netif_carrier_on
			is called, in SetDeepSleep(), in wlan_wext.c.
		3. Reversed the the working of reasso-on/off.
			i.e, $ iwpriv eth1 reasso-on
			      -- Driver does the reassociation automatically.
			     $ iwpriv eth1 reasso-off
			      -- User has to associate to the network manually
		4. Added the checks to find out whether the card is in
			DeepSleep. If the card is in DeepSleep, IOCTLS are
			returned back with appropriate error condition,
		5. Changed USER_DOES_REASSOCIATION flag name to
			USER_DOES_PS_AFTER_REASSOCIATION
		6. Changed "getadhocchannel to "getadhocch" and

		8. Used 'MIN' macro instead of 'min' finction in 
			wlan_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start(), in wlan_cmd.c.
			(this is done to remove error in THREADX).
		9. Modified the functions, wlan_get_snr() and wlan_get_nf().
			Here, changed the way the in which the NF values are
			given to the user.
			To get the NF value, first the user should issue,

			and then issue,
				$ iwpriv ethX getNF <option same as above>
			to get the NF values.
		10. Moved the handling of Power Management form low-level 
			driver to wlan module.
		
12/15/04:  version 22
		1. Added the flag THROUGHPUT_TEST in Makefile.
		2. Added a private command("thruput") to handle the THROUGHPUT_TEST.
		   (Usage: iwpriv eth1 thruput 1 - Tx Throughput test starts
			   iwpriv eth1 thruput 2 - Rx Throughput test starts
			   iwpriv eth1 thruput 3 - Tx/RX Throughput test starts
			   iwpriv eth1 thruput 0 - Stops the througput test going on)
		3. Modified wlan_service_main_thread to handle the TX/RX throughput
		   tests.
		4. Added 3 variable to wlan_adapter in case of Throughput tests for
		   statistics.

12/14/04:  version 22
		1. Corrected the display of the channels for band 'a'
			when user issues 'iwconfig ethX' and 
			'iwlist ethX channel'.

12/13/04:  version 21
		1. wlan_scan_networks() and wlan_set_scan() finctions are 
			modified to scan at the max two bands, i.e, b/g and a,
			depending on the F/W and user configuration.
		2. In wlan_get_rate(), removed the data rate command to get 
			the data rate from the F/W.
		3. Added the variable Is_DataRate_Auto in the adapter structure
			to know whether the data rate is set to auto/fixed type 
		4. Added the below code in ProcessRxed_802_3_Packet(),
			if (Adapter->Is_DataRate_Auto)
				Adapter->DataRate = pRxPD->RxRate; 
			to store the data rate form 'pRxPD->RxRate' in to the 
			adapter variable 'DataRate' only if the rate type set by
			the user is auto. 
		5. Is_DataRate_Auto variable is set or reset in the function 
			wlan_set_rate(), if the user sets the rate as 
			auto or fixed.

				$iwpriv ethX setadhocchannel "a 36"
					-- this will store the band 'a' and 
					   channel 36 info in adapter variables 
					   adhoc_start_band and adhoc_start_ch 
					   This information will be used only to
					   start the ad-hoc network.

				$iwpriv ethX getadhocchannel

12/08/04:  version 21
		1. In wlan_process_tx: handling of MrvDrvSend failure case

12/08/04:  version 20
		1. Added new function wlan_scan_networks(), in wlan_wext.c
			to do the scan. If multiband support is enabled,
			it does the scan in all the user configured bands.

			in hostcmd.h.
		6. In wlan_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start(), if the AdhocChannel value
			is zero and the band is 'a', then set the default adhoc
			channel of 'a' band. Currently the default channel
			for 'a' band is set to 36.
		7. SCAN_MAX_CH_TIME for multibands is set to 100 in hostcmd.h
		8. Added DataRate variable in SCAN command. Increased size of
			Datarate and Reserved variable in ad-start command to 14
			and also increased the DataRates variable in ad-join
			command to 14 in hostcmd.h.

12/07/04:  version 19
		1. Changed the variable name from BasicDataRates to DataRates 
			and from OpRateSet to Reserved in the structure 
			_HostCmd_DS_802_11_AD_HOC_START in hostcmd.h.
		2. In wlan_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start(), the current band
			data rates are used to start the ad-hoc network if 
			MULTI_BANDS support exist, otherwise the information
			in the SupportedRates is used to start the ad-hoc
			network.
		3. In wlan_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start(), after copying the 
			required data rates, the MSB of the basic rates are set.
		4. The rate information in the SupportedRates array is not 
			changed in the wlan_ret_802_11_band_config(), in
			wlan_cmdresp.c.
		5. Changed main thread name from "wlan_service_pending_ints" to
			"wlan_service_main_thread".

			sent.
		
12/06/04:  version 19
		1. Added configuration flag MULTI_BANDS in Makefile.
		2. In ad-hoc start, the BasicDataRates and the OpDataRates
			are copied from the SupportedRates array in
			wlan_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_start().
		   In ad-hoc join, the DataRates are copied from the rates
		   	got from scan response in wlan_cmd_802_11_ad_hoc_join(),
			in wlan_cmd.c.
		3. Removed HostCmd_OPTION_WAITFORRSP flag for DEEP_SLEEP command

			of HOST_WAKE_UP_CFG and HOST_AWAKE_CONFIRM commands
		3. HOST_WAKEUP: wakeup firmware in PS mode, if no
			pending interrupt but Tx data or command is ready
		4. Removed unused variable tx_done_received

12/03/04:  version 19
		1. Added new flag MULTI_BANDS in Makefile.
			Added 3 flags:
			config_bands		- user's requested bands.
			fw_bands		- bands supported by FW.
			bss_band		- band of a particular node.
			curr_band		- operating band

			band configuration	- user can set a band, which the
							FW supports.
			scan 	 		- Remembering the bss_band of 
						the node if connected and scan 
						all config_bands and set the 
						band to remembered bss_band.
			association/adhoc	- The user has to know the band
						of the node he wants to connect
						either by scanning (or by other
						means) and set to the band if 
						not in, and then connect.
			rate setting		- TODO 
		2. Commented out the code that changes DataRate in 
			wlan_set_mode(), wlan_set_essid() & JoinAdhocNetwork()
		3. Changed HOST_WAKEUP related commands' names

12/02/04:  version 18
		1. Added get_version() function: changed versioning format to
		   "sd8385-3.0.17-19-(5.11.18)" --- no f/w patch number, or
		   "spi8381-3.1.5.p2-21-(9.13.18)" --- f/w patch number is 2
		2. Removed 50ms delay in association response

12/01/04:  version 18
		1. Set max_qual.level and max_qual.noise to 0 in wlan_get_range()
		2. Fixed bug #2796: Buffalo AP set to g-only won't associate
		   NEW_ASSOCIATION not to use infraCapInfo, instead,
		   We use BssDescList[i].Cap (from SCAN response) as pAsso->CapInfo
		   This is to fix association problem with g-only Buffalo
		   (reserved bit: G mode short Slot Time)
		3. Adapter->infraCapInfo defined for OLD association only
		4. wlan_service_pending_ints(): RX(rx data, cmd response, mac event)
		   handling: update HisRegCpy before processing

11/30/04:  version 18
		1. Added a new field to display the type of AP (b/g/a) 
			in the scan results.
		2. Added new flags (CARD_A/CARD_B/CARD_G) in the Makefile 
			to configure the type of card.
		3. BAND_CONFIG command is sent before the ASSOCIATE, 
			AD_HOC_START and AD_HOC_JOIN commands.
			Note: still working on, sending the BAND_CONFIG 
			      Command before SCAN Command.
		4. Added private command to set/get the bands, which is used by 
			the driver during the scan.
			
			usage:
				$ iwpriv ethX getscanband
				   - this will get the current band status
				     that is used by the Scan Command.
				     				     
				$ iwpriv ethX setscanband abg
				   - to scan the bands 'a','b' and 'g',
				     when user does a Scan.

				$ iwpriv ethX setscanband bg
				   - to scan the bands 'b' and 'g',
				     when user does a Scan.

				 similarly other combinations can be done.
		5. Added variable bHostWakeupDevRequired and its handling
				     
11/29/04:  version 18
		1. Debug levels are added in the code to control the number of

			In 'wlan/' directory all the 
				1. PRINTK are changed to PRINTK1, 
				2. printk are changed to PRINTK and 
				3. ENTER/LEAVE use PRINTK2.
			The debug level is configured in Makefile,
			LEVEL:
			  n:	No Debug
			  0:	Only PRINTK
			  1:	PRINTK and PRINTK1
			  2:	PRINTK, PRINTK1, PRINTK2, ENTER and LEAVE.
		2. wlan_cmdresp.c: InterpretBSSDescriptionWithIE():
			#define IE_ID_LEN_FIELDS_BYTES 2
			

11/24/04:  version 18
		1. New list implementation is added in the driver to handle 
			the CmdFreeQ and CmdPendingQ instead of the Q_Keeper.
		2. Initialized the CmdFreeQ and CmdPendingQ before 
			starting the service_pending_ints thread in 
			wlan_add_card(), in wlan_main.c during initialization.
			This is because, when the service_pending_ints thread 
			is started, it checks the CmdPendingQ before the
			schedule() call in the thread. So CmdPendingQ has to 
			be initialized before this thread is started.
		3. Changed the type of CapInfo in old association command and 
			association response structure from USHORT to 
			IEEEtypes_CapInfo_t.
		4. Added the BAND_CONFIG command to support 802.11a band,
			and added WLAN_802_11a flag in the Makefile to support 
			this (not yet complete).

		1. Special handling of IntCounter for PS on SDIO/Bulverde

11/16/04:  version 17
		1. PrepareAndSendCommand call is added in 
			wlan_process_rx_command() in wlan_cmdresp.c to do the 
			progressive scan. This is to handle progressive scan 
			command in scan-command response instead of in 
			ExecuteNextCommand.
			Also commented the PrepareAndSendCommand call, to do
			progressive scan in ExecuteNextCommand() in wlan_cmd.c
			Reset the variable 'Adapter->ScanChannelsLeft' in 
			wlan_process_rx_command() in wlan_cmdresp.c, when the 
			scan command is not successfull.
		2. Removed the DelayedExec List implementation. Also removed 
			DelayedExec Thread code and PowerSave Thread code,
			since it was commented and not used in the driver.

			PrepareAndSendCommand
		3. Also check !Adapter->CmdCmd before DownloadCommandToStation

11/16/04:  version 16
		1. Handle Progressive SCAN in ExecuteNextCommand

11/11/04:  version 16
		1. Moved ListenInterval out of PS_REQUIRED in Adapter struct
		2. In wlan_cmd.c, added TX_INTERRUPT_SAVE_AREA for THREADX
		3. Do not SleepConfirm, if IntCounter != 0
		4. After SleepConfirm, free CurrentTxSkb if any
		5. Check !dnld_sent and CurrentTxSkb (instead of HisRegCpy) 
			for wlan_process_tx
		6. Check packet size of Tx data received from kernel, report 
			error and free skb

11/10/04:  version 16
		1. CmdNode removed from Adapter struct

			host_to_card cmd download
		4. In wlan_cmd.c: set TxDnLdRdy bit in HisRegCpy and clear 
			dnld_sent for DS cmd 0x003e and IEEE Enter_PS, we 
			won't expect TxDnLdRdy interrupt for these commands.
		5. After DS cmd 0x003e is sent: backup IntCounter and 
			free/drop CurrentTxSkb if any
		6. In wlan_wext.c: before sbi_deep_sleep_wakeup() restore 
			IntCounter
		7. In wlan_wext.c: after sbi_deep_sleep_wakeup() wakeup 
			intThread if IntCounterSaved > 0

11/09/04:  version 16
		1. Removed the check for CurrentTxSkb in wlan_service_pending_ints(),
		in wlan_fw.c. When we get the txdone event or when we get skb
			from the OS we increment the IntCounter. So checking for 
			CurrentTxSkb is not required. This also prevents from freezing 
			of the system when, while fast ping + removal of the card.
		2. Reset the flag 'priv->wlan_dev.dnld_sent' before calling wlan_process_tx()
			in wlan_service_pending_ints(), in wlan_fw.c.
			This is done because we have to reset this flag when we get the 
			txdone event.
		3. Added function call wireless_send_event() in the function wlan_remove_card() 
			to notify the supplicant by sending the event on removal 
			of card. This is the fix for WPA reassociation on unplug/plug
			of the CF card.
		4. Modified wlan_cmd_802_11_scan() and wlan_init_adapter() function to
			use ScanMode flag to support iwpriv ethX scanmode priate ioctl
			command.
		5. Changes are made for WPA-AES in fwtypes.h, hostcmd.h and in function
			Changed wlan_set_encode_wpa() in wlan_wext.c file.
		6. Updated distclean target in the Makefile to remove .config file in 
			'Src' directory.
		7. In DownloadCommandToStation, if dnld_sent is set call wlan_sched_timeout(100)
			and wait for the TxDone then retry.
		8. Added the check for 'Adapter->SurpriseRemoved' flag along with 
			kthread->Terminate to break out of loop, when card is unplugged
			in wlan_service_pending_ints(), in wlan_fw.c.
			This is the fix for freezing of the system, while fast ping + un-plug 
			the card.
		9. Retained the check for CurrentTxSkb in wlan_service_pending_ints(),
			in wlan_fw.c.
		10. Removed the resetting of the flag 'dnld_sent' in wlan_serveice_pending_ints() 
			before calling wlan_process_tx() in wlan_fw.c.
		11. Removed the implementation of CMD_802_11_BEACON_CW and 
			CMD_802_11_GENERATE_ATIM from common module.
		12. Merged the THREADX code. 
			Changes are also made in the adapter structure.
		13. Resolved bug# 2720.
			Modified wlan_set_freq(), to send the command to set the wep key
			in the f/w.
		14. Resolved bug# 2722.
			Modified wlan_set_mode() to send command to remove wep key and
			modified wlan_set_essid() to check for authentication mode
			before sending the authentication mode.
		15. CmdNode added in Adapter struct to send CMD in intThread
		16. In wlan_cmd.c: point current command to CmdNode and wake up intThread to download
		17. In PrepareAndSendCommand(): check for CurCmd (CMD sent waiting for resp) and
		    CmdNode (CMD pending for Tx). wlan_sched_timeout for 100ms and retry if busy
		18. DELAYED_EXEC macro disabled (check if it's OK for other platforms !!!)
		19. In wlan_tx.c: for Tx data, removed IntCounter++ flag
		20. In wlan_fw.c: Added Adapter->CmdNode check and CMD Tx handling in intThread
		21. In wlan_fw.c: call sbi_get_int_status() ONLY if Adapter->IntCounter is set for
		    interrupts(Rx data, MAC event, CMD Resp, TxDone)
		22. Implemented the private command to set and get the 
			listen interval.
		23. Implemented the private command to set and get the 
			Multiple DTIM value.
		24. Tested WPA-AES, changed related structures in hostcmd.h and removed obselete
			code from wlan_cmd_802_11_associate() in wlan_cmd.h


11/03/04:  version 15
		1. Added new private command setwpaie.
		2. Changed if (pkey->keylength <= 16) to (pkey->keylength < 16) in
			wlan_set_encode_wpa(). This is done to support WPA_AES.
		3. Added a WPA_AES flag in Makefile.
		4. New private ioctl region code frame work is added (not yet complete).
		5. Added new private ioctl radioon and radiooff.

			CONFIG_ADHOCAES flag and CONFIG_WPA_AES flag were disabled 
			in the MakeFile. For this, changes are also made in the MakeFile.
		8. Added code '#if !defined(linux) && !defined(THREADX)' in host.h
				for THREADX code compilation.
		9. Added THREADX code.
		8. New function wlan_set_region() is added to set the region code
			in wlan_wext.c. This is required for THREADX.

			Added new function wlan_cmd_802_11_cal_data() in wlan_wext.c.
			Added new ioctl for CAL_DATA command.
			Added new structure 'wlan_ioctl_cal_data' in wlan_wext.h.

			USAGE: ./wlanconfig eth1 caldata < options >
			-----
				The options are:
					-a	action: i.e, to set | get <val>
					-o	calibration option <val>				
					-e	type of PA <val>
					-A	Antenna selection <val>
					-i	calibiration for channel <val>
					-c	calibiration for RF register <val>
					-d	Regularitaty domain <val>
					-E	ECO present or not <val>
					-l	VGA capacitor calibiration <val>
					-m	MAC Address <a:b:c:d:e:f>

				Here the MAC Address is also required since we 
				have to send MAC Address after we send the set
				cal_data command.
		
			NOTE: The PrepareAndSendCommand in do_ioctl for sending 
			----    this command is commented for now.
			
10/21/04:  version 13
		1. merged THREADX code
		2. fixed Watchdog timeout for each ping request (in wlan_tx.c)

10/20/04:  version 12
		1. fixed: a line break caused compiling error when 
			NEW_ASSOCIATE enabled
		2. BIG_ENDIAN and THREADX defined code added
		3. 4 *.h files for THREADX added: 
			ThreadX_macros.h wireless.h 
			conversion_routines.h wlan_net_device.h
		4. Removed elements in struct _HostCmd_DS_802_11_ASSOCIATE in
			hostcmd.h. This is done for NEW_ASSOCIATION.
		5. NF calculation added for SPIn8385.
		6. wlan_process_tx is called after handling TxDnLdRdy.
		7. netif_wake_queue is commented before calling wlan_process_tx
			in service_pending_int thread
		8. netif_wake_queue is uncommented in wlan_process_tx().
		9. Added "dev->trans_start = jiffies" in wlan_hard_start_xmit.
		10. Commented trans_start and netif_wake_queue in MACREG_INT_CODE_DUMMY_PACKET
			case of wlan_process_event function.
		12. Changed the order of handling servicing the interrupts in
			wlan_pending_ints.
		13. sbi_reenable_host_interrupt is called before calling 
			wlan_process_rx_command function, in 
			wlan_service_pending_ints
		14. Modified Makefile to support CF8305 and changes compilation
			flag naming convention for SPIn.
		15. In wlan_service_pending_ints(): set tx_done_received to 1 if HIS_TxDnLdRdy is set
		    and call wlan_process_tx if tx_done_received is set AND CurrentTxSkb is filled.
		    This will prevent the TX from dead lock if TxDone received earier than CurrentTxSkb 
		    is filled.
		16. 'HisRegCpy' variable is used to check the type of the interrupt instead of 
			'ireg' variable in wlan_service_pending_ints().
		17. Added code 'priv->adapter->HisRegCpy |= ireg' after reading the interrupt 
			status by calling sbi_get_int_status() in wlan_service_pending_ints().
		18. Added code 'Adapter->HisRegCpy &= ~HIS_RxUpLdRdy' before calling 
			ProcessRxedPacket() in wlan_service_pending_ints().
		19. Uncommented the call to wlan_process_tx() after checking TxDnLdRdy bit in 
			HisRegCpy variable in wlan_service_pending_ints().
		20. Commented the check for 'tx_done_received' and 'Adapter->CurrentTxSkb' and 
			also the call to wlan_process_tx(). This is removed because we accumulate 
			the TxDnLdRdy event in the HisRegCpy variable after reading the interrupt 
			status and in wlan_process_tx() we also make the check for 
			Adapter->CurrentTxSkb. So, when we get the tx_done event, we accumulate it
			in HisRegCpy. Only when the CurrentTxSkb is filled we send down the packet.
		21. Added the code 'priv->adapter->HisRegCpy &= ~HIS_TxDnLdRdy' in wlan_process_tx(),
			after we send down the skb successfully and before making the call
			netif_wake_queue().
		22. Added new wlan_set_mac_address() in wlan_main.c,
			Changed wlan_main.c, wlan_cmd.c, wlan_cmdresp.c, hostcmd.h.
			usage:
			# ifconfig eth1 hw ether <MAC Address>
			# ifconfig eth1 up
			# ifconfig
		23. Changed 'ULONG i' to 'int i' in wlan_cmd_802_11_associate().
			This is done for new association reassociation.

		20. Changed the Adapter->Reassociate values in case 
			WLANREASSOCIATIONUSER & case WLANREASSOCIATIONAUTO,
			in wlan_wext.c. 
			And made Adapter->Reassociate = TRUE in wlan_init_adapter(),

			private ioctls oppositly and to enable reassociation
			by default.
		21. Added three private ioctls atimgen, set/getbcncw, setpretbtt.

			IsNetworkCompatible() in wlan_fw.h and StartReassociation() in 
			wlan_cmdresp.c.
			In wlan_cmdresp.c, Changed ucElemLen to 24, in case WPA_IE,
			in InterpretBSSDescriptionWithIE() in wlan_cmdresp.c

09/24/04:  version 10
		1. Resolved bug #1030, Modified wlan_set_wap() in wlan_wext.c
			And also modified SSIDcmp(), FindSSIDInList(),
			FindBSSIDInList(), FindBestSSIDInList() and added
			IsNetworkCompatible() in wlan_fw.h.
			Moved IsWPAEnabled() from wlan_wext.c to wlan_fw.h.
		2. Enabling and Disabling of RSN by sending ENABLE_RSN command to 
			firmware is done when wpa_supplicant does ioctl for "wpa on"
			and "wpa off" respectively. so removed the code where we send this command 
			to firmware i.e., wlan_cmd_802_11_associate() in wlan_cmd.c and
			ResetDisconnectStatus() in wlan_cmdresp.c
		3. Changed wlan_encode_nonwpa() in wlan_wext.c 
			If user changes to ad-hoc mode and says $iwconfig eth1 key [1]; then 
			we are sending a error message operation not permitted as the 
			key is not specified. Previously, with out user giving the key
			we were enabling the transmit key.
		4. Resolved bug # 968, Removed wlan_get_rate() call in wlan_set_essid();
			This is for when the user associates to a new AP, we are setting the data rate
			to  max. supported data rate.
		5. Resolved bug #996, sending de-authentication command, if the media status is 
			connected in wlan_set_essid() and wlan_set_wap() in wlan_wext.c
		6. Indented the wlan module code.
		7. Resolved bug #1049, Modified wlan_remove_card() in wlan_main.c,
			If the card is put to deep sleep and tried to unload the module,
			we are making the card full power and then allowing to unload the module.
		8. Added new private ioctls to support Radio Frequency Interface Tx mode and Rx mode.
			in wlan_cmd.c, wlan_cmdresp.c, wlan_wext.c, wlan_wext.h & hostcmd.h
		9. Bluetooth Coexistence Arbitration (BCA) configuration API added.
			usage:
			# iwpriv eth1 bca "get"		
				--- read current bca configuration
			# iwpriv eth1 bca "set 0 x x xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx xxxxxxxx"
				--- disable bca (default)
			# iwpriv eth1 bca "set 3 1 3 f0001000 0000aaaa f0001000 0000aaaa"	
				--- set CSR bluetool priority highest
			# iwpriv eth1 bca "set 7 1 3 f0001000 0000aaaa f0001000 0000aaaa"
				--- set wlan priority highest
		10. In Makefile, Added a variable CONFIG_SD_SPI8381_B1 for enabling support 
			for SD_SPI8381_B1 card.
	     	11. Changed Adapter->IntCounter in wlan_fw.c to make multi cast command
	        	work properly.
		12. wlan_wext.c wlan_get_power function return 0,
			if we are not connected to any AP.
		13. In Makefile, Added the OMAP_GPIO_WORKAROUND as GPIO1 line 
		  	is not working on one of the OMAPs.

09/13/04:  version 9
		1. Modified the WPA buffer size from 50 to 64, the buffer size increase is because of the 
			"wpa_ie=" string that is added at the beginning of the custom event.
			So we would need at least 14 more bytes.
		2. Added Reassociation on and off; when the user sets on, then Reassociation is disabled
			and vice-versa.
		3. Added code for new deep sleep, the code is not tested.
		4. Added new sub-commands for getSNRbeacon, getSNRdata, getNFbeacon, getNFdata.
			these are for giving the raw SNR and NF values to the user.
			Needed to define CAL_SNR appropriately.
		5. Added passive scan.	
		6. Resolved #bug 983.
		7. Resolved bug #958, #968.
			In wlan_set_essid();
			we are getting current data rate by calling wlan_get_rate().
			And comparing the current data rate with AP supported data rates.
			If current date rate is greater than max data rate the AP supports
			then we are calling wlan_set_rate() with APs max. rate.
			In wlan_set_rate();
			If user requests a data rate value other than Supported rates(basic & extended),
			then we are returning an error EINVAL.
		 	when the mode is changed to ad-hoc the data rate is set to 11Mbps.
		        The user is not allowed to set data rate more than 11Mbps in ad-hoc mode or when
			associated to B access point.
		8. Cleaned up WITH_SUB_CMDS in wlan_wext.h and wlan_wext.c
		9. LEAP_ENABLED macro is added to support LEAP + WPA. 
			Note: LEAP is working, but it is not stable.
			LEAP_ENABLED macro should be enabled in Makefile.
	        10. wpaon and wpaoff in wlan_private_handler[] have been moved in the array, as
		   	the ioctl numbers were not mapped properly.
		11. Modified the implementation SNR, NF and RSSI.
			in wlan_wext.c,
				merged wlan_get_snr_beacon() and wlan_get_snr_data() to 
					wlan_get_snr().
				merged wlan_get_nf_beacon() and wlan_get_nf_data() to	
					wlan_get_nf().
				merged wlan_get_rssi_beacon() and wlan_get_rssi_data() to	
					wlan_get_rssi().
				And Modified the respective sub commands.
		12. change to use 3 ioctl for SNR/NF/RSSI: getSNR(0-3),getNF(0-3),getRSSI(0-3)
	 		  0: beacon raw, 1: beacon avg, 2: data raw, 3: data avg
		    CAL_NF and CAL_RSSI marcos: (char)->(int) conversion to avoid positive dBM number issue
		    NFbeacon and NFdata: use CAL_NF conversion before reporting to user
		13. wlan_get_range(): max_qual.level, max_qual.noise, max_qual.sensitivity value changed
		14. wlan_set_wap(); Added Adapter->ulNumOfBSSIDs = 0; for bug #996. 
		15. Resolved bug #996. 
		16. MULTICAST_ENABLE macro added
		17. AD-HOC PS added
		18. Added #ifdef LEAP_ENABLED in function wlan_set_encode() in file wlan_wext.c
		19. Uncommented 	range->freq[j].m = frequency_list[i + 1] * 100000; in wlan_get_range();
			this is done to display the frequencies mapped to channels properly in iwlist.
 
08/30/04:  version 8
	      1. wlan_end_packet() error check to avoid kernel tx watchdog timeout
	      2. tx/rx share one thread (TX_THREAD macro added in case later we need separate tx thread)
	      3. MAC events MIC_ERR_UNICAST & MIC_ERR_MULTICAST handling added (need redefine in f/w and driver to work)
	      4. code cleanup for MS8380
	      5. implementation of subcommands for
                WLANSETRXANT, WLANSETTXANT, WLANGETRXANT, WLANGETTXANT
                the first 2 commands are combined as WLANSETANTENNA and
                the next 2 commands are combined as WLANGETANTENNA.
                Also formed the sub-commands for WLANRSSIBEACON, WLANNFBEACON
                WLANRSSIAVG, WLANNFAVG all these are combined as
                WLANRSSI_AND_NF command.
                SetRxAntenna(), SetTxAntenna(), GetRxAntenna(), GetTxAntenna()
                wlan_get_rssi_beacon(), wlan_get_nf_beacon(),
                wlan_get_rssi_avg(), wlan_get_nf_avg() added 
              6. Added wpaon/wpaoff support, for this modified wlan_set_essid() function
                by commenting the  Adapter->WPAEnabled flag update.
	      7. Added check for adhoc mode, if user tries to set the data rate above 11Mbps, 
		driver would give an error code: Operation not supported.
	      8. Resolved bug #968, when we set the essid after we associate,
		we are setting rate to the max.supported rate if fixed-rate specified(before association) exceeds the max rate.
              9. Resolved bug #958, we are not allowing user to set data rate 
		more than supported rates of the AP.
	     10.Added new deauth command for iwpriv 
	     11. Added the fix of new association command. 
	     12. Added check for association for WiFi negative test
		in wlan_set_essid(i.e., both AP and STN has to be either WEP enabled
		or WEP disabled to associate).
	     13. Resolved Bug #291, when we associate with 3 APs with same configuration(same SSID) and
		different encryption (WPA, WEP and none) then we associate to AP without Encryption.
	     14. Changed the buffer size from 50 to 54 in get_scan() for WPA fix. 	
	     15. changed RSSI to SNR
	     16. fixed bug: in PS reassociate to wpa AP, cannot re-enter PS
	     17. fixed bug: when associate to wpa AP, cannot associate to a shared key ap
	     18. throughput significantly improved, in shield room tx/rx no security: > 9Mbit/second
	     19. tx watchdog timeout (tx missing packets) issue fixed
	     20. FTP/TTCP tx transfering session stop problem fixed 
	     21. new association response data structure changed to match SD8385 firmware 3.0.10 (NEW_ASSOCIATION_RSP added)
