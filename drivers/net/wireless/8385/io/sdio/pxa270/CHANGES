09/23/05:  version 18

06/22/05:  version 13
	1. Added GPIO22 interrupt handling

04/25/05:  version 12
	1. Moved code of getting vendor id from if layer to sdio_get_vendor_id()
		in  sdio.c	
	
03/01/05:  version 11
	1. Added flag CONFIG_ARM_2_4_21 in Makefile and in sdio.c to support
		the driver for kernel 2.4.21-rmk.

02/22/05:  version 10
	1. Added "hw_tx_done", "block_size_512", "async_int_mode" to struct
		_mmc_card_rec
	2. Removed setting ASYNC_INT_MODE for 1-bit mode as it will be done in
		IF layer

01/17/05:  version 9
	1. Added code, 
			#ifdef MMC_X 
			#undef MMC_X
			#endif  
			.
			.
			.

			#define MMC_X (my_define)

		for some macros in sdio_bulverde.h, to remove the compilation
		warnings, when the driver is compiled with MontaVista
		Kernel-2.4.20 + WE-16 patch.
	2. Added code,
		#ifndef PIO
			if (hostdata->state != PXA_MMC_FSM_BUFFER_IN_TRANSIT) 
		#endif
		
		in interrupt handler irq() before the call 
		'complete(&hostdata->completion)', to fix the problem of 
		"Read buffer error" on TCP/Rx path when 1-bit mode is used on 
		Bulverde.

		The above code is added because, in 1-bit mode, some times the 
		driver is getting the card interrupt just after starting the
		DMA channel in read_buffer() and before the DMA interrupt occurs.

		That is in read_buffer() before starting the DMA channel, the state 
		is set to PXA_MMC_FSM_BUFFER_IN_TRANSIT, then start DMA channel and 
		wait for DMA interrupt. Before the DMA interrupt is generated, a card
		interrupt is generated and the irq() interrupt handler is called.
		So in irq(), at the end 'complete(&hostdata->completion)' is called
		which wakes up the read_buffer() which is waiting for the DMA 
		interrupt. Now, when the read_buffer() is woken up, it checks 
		whether the state is PXA_MMC_FSM_END_BUFFER, and finds that the 
		state is not correct, so it returns error.

		So, by adding the above code, 'complete(...)' will not be called
		in irq() when the state is set to PXA_MMC_FSM_BUFFER_IN_TRANSIT.

01/05/05:  version 8
	1. Fixed issue: 1/4-bit modes settings for rev ids other than 0x10, 0x03

01/03/05:  version 8
	1. Changed command line parameter "clkrt" to "clkdiv"

12/27/04:  version 8
	1. Removed developers' names and typo

12/20/04:  version 7
	1. Added compiler flag for Intel Bulverde _MAINSTONE Register access

12/15/04:  version 7
	1. Removed the flag CONFIG_PM before suspend variable in 
		_pxa_mmc_hostdata_rec data structure, in sdio_bulverde.h.
	2. Changed the flag CONFIG_PM to OLD_CONFIG_PM. 
		This is because, the handling of the power management is moved 
		to wlan module.
	3. Added _DRAIN_WRITE_BUFFER macro for _USE_INTERNAL_SRAM implementation
	
12/13/04:  version 7
	1. Added compiler flag "_USE_INTERNAL_SRAM" for using PXA270 internal memory as DMA buffer

12/07/04:  version 6
	1. SD8385-B0 and SD8381-B2: Async interrupt mode (BUS_INTERFACE_CONTROL bit 5)
		must be enabled (set to 1) in order for SDIO 1 bit mode and SPI mode to work

11/29/04:  version 5
	1. Debug levels are added in the code to control the number of
		debug statements logged/displayed.
		The debug level is configured in Makefile,
		LEVEL:
		  n:	No Debug
		  0:	Only PRINTK
		  1:	PRINTK and PRINTK1
		  2:	PRINTK, PRINTK1, PRINTK2, ENTER and LEAVE.
	2. Changed PRINTK2 to PRINTK3 in io/sdio/pxa270/sdio.h, due to 
		conflict after introducing _debug levels_.
	3. Added '#ifdef SDIO_DEBUG1' in __rw_ioreg() before PRINTK2 
		in io/sdio/pxa270/sdio.c.

09/30/04:  version 5
	1. Kite 2 (SD8385-B0) card: 1-bit mode needs ECSI (bit 5) to be 1 in BusInterfaceControl register (0x07)
	2. added "chiprev" to struct _mmc_card_rec 

08/30/04:  version 4
	io: 1. set 1/4-bit mode & clkrt via command line options
	    2. MMC_I_MASK_SDIO_INT not cleared in drv_init_completion()
	    3. check if stop_bus_clock_2 returns error to avoid kernel tx watchdog timeout
	    4. udelay(500) removed from read_buffer() & write_buffer() due to fix #2
	    5. #2 also fixes SDIO interface error issue
	    6. 10MHz PS sleep/awake event missing issue fixed (need more verifications)
	    7. functions added: sdio_enter/exit_deep_sleep, changed: suspend(), resume()

07/22/04:  version 3
	1. io: a) fixed "rmmod sdio" device busy
	       b) added code to cold restart-- using IOABORT function 
		  FN0, register 0x06, value to be written - 0x08
	       c) ENABLE_4BIT_MODE defination

07/20/04:  version 2
	1 io: a) clock speed settings not consistent, fixed
